# React Memory Game

A memory game built in React is a game where the player is presented with a set of cards with symbols or images, and the objective is to match pairs of cards by flipping them over two at a time. The game logic involves creating a state that keeps track of the cards that are flipped, checking for matches, and updating the state accordingly. React components are used to render the game interface, handle user interactions, and display updates to the game state.
